# Trading Bot

This is a Python-based trading bot that analyzes stock data and makes trades based on specific criteria. It also sends trade summaries via text message.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12** or later
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- A **MacBook** for running the bot and sending iMessages (as the bot uses AppleScript for sending messages).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Bot

1. **Ensure the virtual environment is activated** (see step 3 above).

2. **Set up your Robinhood credentials** as environment variables:

   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     export ROBINHOOD_USERNAME='your_username'
     export ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD='your_password'
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     set ROBINHOOD_USERNAME=your_username
     set ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```

3. **Configure your settings**:

   Open the `utils/settings.py` file and adjust the settings as needed, including setting `SIMULATED` to `False` if you want to run live trades.

4. **Run the bot**:

   ```bash
   python3 bot.py
   ```

### Notes

- The bot is currently set up to send trade summaries via iMessage to a specified phone number. Ensure that iMessage is configured and active on the MacBook running the bot.
  
- If you need to update or add dependencies, update the `requirements.txt` file by running:

  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that:

- The virtual environment is activated.
- All dependencies are installed.
- Robinhood credentials are correctly set as environment variables.
