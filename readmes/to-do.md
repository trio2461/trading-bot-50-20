### README: **Future To-Do List**

#### **1. Implement Cron Jobs for Automated Trading Checks**
- **Objective**: Set up automated Cron jobs that run daily or hourly during market open hours to perform key trading checks.
  
  **Tasks**:
  - **Daily Scan**: 
    - Implement a daily scan to check if any of your open trades are ready to be executed or have surpassed the timeline of five days.
    - Verify how many trade spots are available (maximum of 3 trades at any given time).
  - **Hourly Scan**:
    - Implement an hourly scan during market open hours to look for new trading opportunities.
    - This scan should run the program to identify potential trades, considering only those that "would have been taken" if trade spots are full.

#### **2. Manage Trade Slots and Availability**
- **Objective**: Ensure that the system correctly tracks and limits the number of active trades to a maximum of three at any given time.
  
  **Tasks**:
  - **Active Trade Management**:
    - Implement logic to manage and track the current number of active trades.
    - Ensure that the system prevents new trades from being executed if three trade slots are already occupied.
  - **Check Trade Timeline**:
    - Implement checks to ensure that trades are closed if they have reached or exceeded a five-day holding period.
    - Reevaluate these trades to determine if they should be sold or continue holding.

#### **3. Incorporate "Would Have Been Taken" Trades**
- **Objective**: Keep a log of potential trades that were identified but not executed due to the maximum number of active trades being reached.
  
  **Tasks**:
  - **Logging Potential Trades**:
    - Implement functionality to log all trades that were identified as good opportunities but were not executed because the three trade slots were already filled.
    - Provide insights into how often these opportunities arise and their potential performance.
  - **Review Mechanism**:
    - Create a mechanism to periodically review these "would have been taken" trades to assess their effectiveness and possible missed opportunities.

#### **4. Additional Considerations**
- **Objective**: Ensure the system is thorough and covers all scenarios that may arise during automated trading.

  **Tasks**:
  - **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
    - Implement comprehensive error handling to manage unexpected events such as API failures or market anomalies.
  - **Notifications**:
    - Set up notifications for when trades are executed, skipped, or when the five-day timeline is reached for any trade.
  - **Performance Monitoring**:
    - Incorporate monitoring to track the overall performance of the trading bot, including success rates and missed opportunities.
  - **Dynamic Adjustments**:
    - Consider implementing dynamic adjustments to the trading strategy based on performance data, such as adjusting the maximum number of trades or the timeline based on historical results.
